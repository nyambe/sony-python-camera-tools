# Sony Camera Tools

This project provides tools for working with Sony camera files. Currently, it includes the following tools:

- `sony_sd_reader.py`: A script for reading Sony SD cards and copying the files to a local directory.
- `read_sony_xml.py`: A script for parsing Sony camera XML metadata files and extracting key values.
- `gui_sony_xml.py`: A graphical user interface (GUI) tool for browsing and parsing Sony camera XML metadata files.

## Getting Started

To use these tools, you'll need Python 3 and the following Python packages:

- `tkinter` (for the GUI tool only)
- `xml.etree.ElementTree`



This are my first steps with python so please help me out or comment on it.
